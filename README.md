## 📖 Overview
This project implements a **real-time obstacle detection and emergency braking decision system** on a resource-constrained STM32F401VE microcontroller (84 MHz Cortex-M4, 96 KB RAM, 512 KB Flash) using TinyML techniques. The entire pipeline—from model conversion to hardware-software co-simulation—was executed without physical hardware, relying on **Proteus for full-system emulation**.

A pre-trained binary classification model (`model.onnx`) is quantized to **INT8** via STM32Cube.AI, leveraging CMSIS-NN kernels. The embedded firmware processes a simulated 96×96 grayscale image, runs inference, calculates Time-to-Collision (TTC), and drives a Finite State Machine (FSM) to output actuator signals (Warning / Brake).

> ⚠️ **Key Constraint:** All inference, preprocessing, and decision logic must fit within **< 80 KB RAM** and meet strict latency budgets on a microcontroller without an FPU.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **End-to-end TinyML deployment** on Arm Cortex-M4 (no RTOS, bare-metal C).
- **INT8 post-training quantization** with memory footprint analysis in Cube.AI.
- **Bitwise & fixed-point preprocessing** to avoid floating-point operations.
- **Finite State Machine (FSM)** with four safety-critical states: `NORMAL`, `WARNING`, `BRAKE`, `SAFE_STOP`.
- **TTC-based risk assessment** (distance / velocity) for deterministic braking logic.
- **Simulated sensor input**: Static test image stored in Flash as a `const` array.
- **Full Proteus virtual prototype** including UART terminal for logging and timing metrics.
- **Cycle-accurate latency measurement** using on-chip SysTick timer (avoiding host OS overhead).

## 🚀 Getting Started (Replication)

1. **Clone this repo** and open the `.ioc` file in STM32CubeMX; regenerate code if needed.
2. Open the Keil project under `firmware/MDK-ARM/`, ensure Cube.AI library is linked.
3. If required, re-import `model.onnx` into Cube.AI plugin, set INT8 quantization, and regenerate the AI library.
4. Build the project (Target: STM32F401VE) → `.hex` file generated.
5. In Proteus, load the provided schematic, double-click the MCU, and set the program file to the generated `.hex`.
6. Start simulation; observe logs in Virtual Terminal and monitor the state machine via GPIO pins.

## ⚡ Challenges & Solutions
- **RAM limitation:** The 96 KB SRAM forced aggressive weight sharing and input buffer reuse. INT8 quantization reduced memory by 4× compared to FP32.
- **Lack of FPU:** All preprocessing math replaced with integer arithmetic and bit shifts.
- **Latency profiling in Proteus:** Used internal SysTick timer to get true inference time, ignoring host OS simulation lag.
- **No camera in simulation:** A static Flash array served as a deterministic test vector.
